    + `YEAR`: four-digit year
    + `SEMESTER`: semester of the academic year 
    + __IMPORTANT:__ In the head section of the `md` file (wrapped by `+++ ... +++`) please include the field `description = "XX"`, where `XX` is a two-digit number (including a zero first for single-digit numbers) that is increasing in the edition of the group. _This enables the website to be correctly compiled and always show the most recent edition as front page._
