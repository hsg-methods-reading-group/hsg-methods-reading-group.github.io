### <i class="bi bi-info-circle"></i> How To

The general guidelines and "house rules" we follow are much inspired by those of e.g. the [TS&ML Reading Group](https://www.personal.soton.ac.uk/cz1y20/Reading_Group/mlts-group-2023.html) at the University of Southampton.

We will alternate over time so that each person can try and fulfill the two main roles at least once:

* <b style="color: chocolate">Presenter</b>: the person who presents (with annotated paper, whiteboard, slides...) the meeting's topic -- they act as the 'key expert' on the chosen paper/chapter/topic, and go over the core points of the material, step by step. The presenter should be well-prepared in the content presented, and be able to provide a _compact but transparent and technically accessible_ presentation of the material.
    
* <b style="color: blueviolet">Discussant</b>: the person that, having read in some detail the material pertaining to the the meeting, can help steer the discussion: what are some key issues or questions? What things may be unclear? What are the strengths and weaknesses? Your role is to help everyone in the session *navigate and understand the main ideas* discussed.

The following (total) preparation times are suggested:

+ <b style="color: chocolate">Presenter</b>: approx. *10 hours*
+ <b style="color: blueviolet">Discussant</b>: approx. *5 hours*
+ <b style="color: forestgreen">General audience</b>: approx. *2 hours*

> If you encounter any issues with the materials, do not hesitate to contact us!
