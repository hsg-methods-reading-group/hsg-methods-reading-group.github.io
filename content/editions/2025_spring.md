1. [Efron & Tibshirani - An Introduction to the Bootstrap (1993)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/8gapprsv0zb4c20qignmf/An-Introduction-to-the-Bootstrap-Bradley-Efron-R.J.-Tibshirani.pdf?rlkey=qeit62j92cay09c8n6a5rn2y6&st=2hkn42b9&dl=0)
<br>
Classical reference for the boostrap method, based on the theory developed rougly before 2000. Includes theoretical
analysis of classical problems like variance and bias estimates, the jackknife, confidence intervals and testing.

2. [Shao & Tu - The Jackknife and Bootstrap (1995)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mfxzv05x8a8ytl3ctkr50/The-Jackknife-and-Bootstrap-Jun-Shao-Dongsheng-Tu.pdf?rlkey=fq536ao5qc52zdu6xinivalye&dl=0)
<br>
Another classical reference book for bootstrap methods. Unlike Efron & Tibshirani (1993), it focuses on the core (but also more advanced) *mathematical theory* of the bootstrap itself (see Chapter 3).
Detailed treatment of important applications in econometric/statistical analysis include: linear models (Chapter 7); nonparametric models (Chapter 8), and time series and dependent data (Chapter 9).

<br>
Broad book that can serve as a reference for many contemporary methods in statistical analysis and learning. Chapters 10 and 11 present the bootstrap and the jackknife from a high-level perspective.

<br>
A book containing many empirical examples of uses of bootstrap methods.

### <i class="bi bi-info-circle"></i> How To

The general guidelines and "house rules" we follow are much inspired by those of e.g. the [TS&ML Reading Group](https://www.personal.soton.ac.uk/cz1y20/Reading_Group/mlts-group-2023.html) at the University of Southampton.

We will alternate over time so that each person can try and fulfill the two main roles at least once:

* <b style="color: chocolate">Presenter</b>: the person who presents (with annotated paper, whiteboard, slides...) the meeting's topic -- they act as the 'key expert' on the chosen paper/chapter/topic, and go over the core points of the material, step by step. The presenter should be well-prepared in the content presented, and be able to provide a _compact but transparent and technically accessible_ presentation of the material.
    
* <b style="color: blueviolet">Discussant</b>: the person that, having read in some detail the material pertaining to the the meeting, can help steer the discussion: what are some key issues or questions? What things may be unclear? What are the strengths and weaknesses? Your role is to help everyone in the session *navigate and understand the main ideas* discussed.

The following (total) preparation times are suggested:

+ <b style="color: chocolate">Presenter</b>: approx. *10 hours*
+ <b style="color: blueviolet">Discussant</b>: approx. *5 hours*
+ <b style="color: forestgreen">General audience</b>: approx. *2 hours*

> If you encounter any issues with the materials, do not hesitate to contact us!
