### <i class="bi bi-book"></i> Additional References

1. [Zhang - Mathematical Analysis of Machine Learning
Algorithms (2023)](https://tongzhang-ml.org/lt-book/lt-book.pdf)
<br>
This recent book covers much of the methods (and the theory needed to study them formally),
including kernel methods, additive models and neural networks. It also discusses online learning.

2. [Bach - Learning Theory from First Principles (2024)](https://www.di.ens.fr/%7Efbach/ltfp_book.pdf)
<br>
Similar to the previous ref., this book also presents nonparametric and ML methods, but
it also starts with an in-depth discussion of linear models. Additional topics include ensemble learning,
overparametrized models and optimization.

3. [Shalev-Shwartz & Ben-David - Understanding Machine Learning (2014)](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf)
<br>
General book that covers (not in detail) the wide landscape of popular ML methods.

4. [Tsybakov - Introduction to Nonparametric Estimation (2009)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b13794)
<br>
Modern (but already classical) reference for the foundational theory of kernel/series methods and minimax analysis.

### <i class="bi bi-info-circle"></i> How To

The general guidelines and "house rules" we follow are much inspired by those of e.g. the [TS&ML Reading Group](https://www.personal.soton.ac.uk/cz1y20/Reading_Group/mlts-group-2023.html) at the University of Southampton.

We will alternate over time so that each person can try and fulfill the two main roles at least once:

* <b style="color: chocolate">Presenter</b>: the person who presents (with annotated paper, whiteboard, slides...) the meeting's topic -- they act as the 'key expert' on the chosen paper/chapter/topic, and go over the core points of the material, step by step. The presenter should be well-prepared in the content presented, and be able to provide a _compact but transparent and technically accessible_ presentation of the material.
    
* <b style="color: blueviolet">Discussant</b>: the person that, having read in some detail the material pertaining to the the meeting, can help steer the discussion: what are some key issues or question? what things are unclear? Your role is to help everyone in the session *navigate and understand the main ideas* discussed.

The following (total) preparation times are suggested:

+ <b style="color: chocolate">Presenter</b>: approx. *10 hours*
+ <b style="color: blueviolet">Discussant</b>: approx. *5 hours*
+ <b style="color: forestgreen">General audience</b>: approx. *2 hours*
